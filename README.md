### 📘 Week 2 – Singly Linked List using OOP

**Goal:** Understand and implement linked data structures with classes.  
**Task:** Create a Singly Linked List with:

- Node & LinkedList classes
- `add_node()` – Add node to end  
- `print_list()` – Print the linked list  
- `delete_nth_node(n)` – Delete the nth node (1-based index)
- Exception handling for empty list / invalid index

**Concepts Used:**  
Classes, object references, method definition, edge case handling.

### 📘 Week 3 – Titanic Dataset Visualization

**Goal:** Perform data visualization using Seaborn and Matplotlib on the Titanic dataset.  
**Task:** Load the Titanic dataset and generate multiple plots for EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis):

- Survival count (`countplot`)
- Survival by gender
- Survival by passenger class
- Age distribution by survival (`histplot`)
- Heatmap of missing values (`heatmap`)
- Save screenshots of each plot

**Concepts Used:**  
DataFrames, Seaborn visualizations, `matplotlib.pyplot`, categorical and continuous data plotting.

### 🖼️ Sample Visualizations

You’ll find the code and screenshots in the [`assignment3/`](assignment3/) folder.

### 📘 Week 4 – Advanced Titanic Data Visualization and Preprocessing

**Goal:** Perform in-depth data analysis, cleaning, imputation, outlier detection, and complex visualization using the Titanic dataset.

**Task:**  
=> Load the Titanic dataset using Seaborn.  
=> Handle missing values using heatmaps and imputation techniques.  
=> Impute missing ages based on passenger class.  
=> Drop irrelevant columns like `deck` and rows with remaining missing data.  
=> Perform univariate and multivariate visualizations:
- Survival count
- Gender distribution
- Passenger class distribution
- Age and fare distribution
- Boxplot for outlier detection
- Survival distribution by gender and class
- Violin plot for survival and age distribution
- Correlation heatmap (numeric columns only)

**Concepts Used:**
- Missing value handling and imputation
- Advanced Seaborn visualizations: violin plots, boxplots, heatmaps
- Outlier detection
- Correlation analysis
- Data cleaning workflows

**Purpose:**  
This task builds on Week 3 and introduces real-world data preprocessing steps, handling missing data, and advanced exploratory data analysis using visual techniques.

### 🖼️ Sample Visualizations

You’ll find the code and screenshots in the [`assignment4/`](assignment4/) folder.

### 📘 Week 5 – House Price Prediction using Machine Learning

**Goal:** Build a machine learning model to predict house prices using the Kaggle dataset:  
[House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/data)

**Task:**
- Load and preprocess the data (handle missing values, label encoding)
- Perform feature engineering:
  - Total bathrooms
  - Total porch area
  - House age
- Train Random Forest Regressor
- Evaluate model using RMSE
- Generate final submission CSV

**Concepts Used:**
- Data preprocessing and imputation
