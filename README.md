# Celebal Tech Internship – Week 1 Tasks

Welcome to my GitHub repository for **Week 1** of the **Data Science Internship at Celebal Tech**.  
This repository contains Python code implementations for basic pattern printing using loops — a foundational task designed to assess understanding of control structures and formatting in Python.

## 🔍 Overview

The tasks completed in this folder include the creation of three different text-based patterns using the `"*"` character:

1. ✅ **Lower Triangular Pattern**
2. ✅ **Upper Triangular Pattern**
3. ✅ **Pyramid Pattern**

These patterns are printed using nested loops and formatted for clarity.
